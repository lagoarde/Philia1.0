# Philia 1.0
Philia 1.0 is an E-views model for post-Keynesian macroeconomics with planetary boundaries. Philia 1.0 monitors the fully traceable causal chain of events uniting some 490 economic financial and ecosystemic variables, in a watertight accounting framework, with thermodynamics and Anthropocenic climate change. It raises analytical insight on the impact of various budgetary, monetary, prudential policies, as well as endogenous technological change on socioeconomic pathways and climate. It highlights some of the paradoxes arising from a true macroeconomic analysis in a finite world. The E-views code modules are scalable so that researchers can easily introduce new variables, change parameter value or include new structural relationships to test their own policy scenarios.

Philia 1.0 comprises seven institutional sectors: a household sector (divided into working and rentier households), a government sector (divided into the Treasure and state-owned firms), social firms consisting of cooperatives owned by working households, a sector of listed non-financial corporations, a banking sector, a Central Bank, and a sector of investment funds comprising unlisted intermediaries (such as institutional investors, asset management companies, and insurance companies). Together these sectors make up the economy. The latter is linked to the ecosystemâ€™s material and energy balance, and to a physical stock and flows matrix measuring the evolution of material reserves, non-renewable energy reserves, atmospheric concentration of CO2 and the socio-economic stock. 


## Files and Running the program
Philia1.0.zip include all the modules.

Philia-PRGM.docx displays the entire program by module in a WORD file.

Technicalappendix_PHILIA.docx describes the accounting and geophysical structure of the model, its numerical properties as well as all of its accounting and behavioral equations.

To run the model in EVIEWS, you just need to launch 00-philia.

For each module, two files are available VP (for VARIABLES AND PARAMETERS) and EQ (for EQUATIONS).

## Modules
In the Philia 1.0 program, the various economic sectors have been segmented into modules for better analysis. 

In all, there are 11 modules:
-	Module 0: the full code 
-	Module 1: GDP components, inflation and the total stock of productive capital
-	Module 2: households: income, consumption, savings and portfolio choice 
-	Module 3: social businesses: income statement, balance sheet, and investment behavior 
-	Module 4: listed firms: income statement, balance sheet, investment behavior and dividend policy   
-	Module 5: banks: credit, portfolio choice, income statement, balance sheet and prudential ratios
-	Module 6: investment funds: income statement, balance sheet and dividend policy
-	Module 7: Central Bank: monetary policy, income statement and balance sheet
-	Module 8: Financial markets: interest rates, stock market prices, expected and realized returns
-	Module 9: Public sector: Treasury, income, balance sheet and investment behavior of state-owned enterprises
-	Module 10: Ecosystem: material and energy resources and reserves, carbon cycle, temperature, resource depletion, eco-efficiency and damage function
-	Module 11: cybernetics-based postgrowth metric: throughput, resilience, and fitness for evolution
-	Module 12: robustness analysis: Monte-Carlo simulation applied to selected parameters
